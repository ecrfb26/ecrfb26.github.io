      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maria Chatzieleftheriou is a CNRS researcher in the CPHT lab of École Polytechnique, Institut Polytechnique de Paris. She obtained her PhD in 2021 from ESPCI Paris and subsequently held postdoctoral positions at École Polytechnique and at Goethe University Frankfurt. Her research focuses on strongly correlated electron systems and in particular on theoretical approaches to local and non-local correlation effects, ranging from toy models to realistic material simulations. Recently, she has been working on the interplay between electronic correlations and flat bands in Kagome metals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/speakers/yang-fangyuan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fangyuan Yang received both her B.S. and Ph.D. in Physics from Fudan University in Shanghai, China. After that, she joined the Department of Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara as a postdoctoral researcher in 2018. Since 2023, she has been a University Assistant at the Institute of Solid State Physics at TU Wien. Her research broadly focuses on novel quantum phenomena in two-dimensional van der Waals materials. Her recent research interests include correlated topological states in the narrow electronic bands of graphene moiré heterostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
